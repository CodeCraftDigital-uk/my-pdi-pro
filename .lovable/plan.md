# Update Website Title & Description

## What Needs Changing

The `index.html` currently reflects the original single-tool identity ("Autexa - PDI Pro") and a narrow description ("Used Vehicle PDI Compliance & Condition Report"). With three tools now live — PDI, Distance Sale Pack Generator, and Dispute Response Builder — the branding needs to reflect the full platform.

## Changes to `index.html`

| Tag | Current Value | New Value |
|---|---|---|
| `<title>` | `Autexa - PDI Pro` | `AutoProv - Automotive Compliance Platform` |
| `<meta name="description">` | `Used Vehicle PDI Compliance & Condition Report` | `Professional automotive compliance tools for UK used car dealers. PDI reports, distance sale packs, and AI-powered dispute responses.` |
| `<meta property="og:title">` | `Autexa - PDI Pro` | `AutoProv - Automotive Compliance Platform` |
| `<meta name="twitter:title">` | `Autexa - PDI Pro` | `AutoProv - Automotive Compliance Platform` |
| `<meta property="og:description">` | `Used Vehicle PDI Compliance & Condition Report` | `Professional automotive compliance tools for UK used car dealers. PDI reports, distance sale packs, and AI-powered dispute responses.` |
| `<meta name="twitter:description">` | `Used Vehicle PDI Compliance & Condition Report` | `Professional automotive compliance tools for UK used car dealers. PDI reports, distance sale packs, and AI-powered dispute responses.` |
| `<meta name="author">` | `Lovable` | `AutoProv` |

Also removes the two stale `<!-- TODO -->` comments that were left in from the original scaffold.

## File Modified

- `index.html` — metadata only, no structural changes
