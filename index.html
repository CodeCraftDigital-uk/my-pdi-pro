            The AutoProv Compliance Tools are a standalone compliance module released ahead of the full AutoProv platform.
            AutoProv is a comprehensive automotive platform for the UK motor trade, covering far more than just compliance.
            These tools — the Used Vehicle PDI Report, Digital Distance Sale Pack, and AI Dispute Response Builder —
            are an early-access module available now at autexa.ai for UK used car dealers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Important distinction:</strong> The compliance tools available here are one part of the broader AutoProv
            platform. AutoProv will expand to cover many more aspects of running a motor trade business beyond compliance.

          <h2 id="tools-heading">Automotive Compliance Tools for UK Used Car Dealers</h2>
          <p>
            Three professional digital compliance tools designed specifically for UK used car dealers,
            independent motor traders, online vehicle retailers, and motor trade compliance officers.
            All tools are aligned to current UK consumer legislation including the Consumer Rights Act 2015
            and the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013.

          <article>
            <h3>Used Vehicle PDI Report</h3>
            <p>
              A digital Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) report tool for UK used car dealers. Before handing over a used vehicle,
              dealers must document its mechanical condition to demonstrate due diligence under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.
              This tool records mechanical checks, tyre tread depths (in millimetres), brake performance, bodywork condition,
              interior condition, and electrics. The customer signs the report digitally at handover, and the completed
              PDI report can be exported as a PDF. A signed PDI report is critical evidence if a buyer later raises a fault
              or seeks to reject the vehicle under the CRA 2015 30-day right to reject or the 6-month burden of proof provisions.
            </p>

            <h3>Digital Distance Sale Pack</h3>
            <p>
              A Distance Sale Pack generator for UK used car dealers selling vehicles remotely — online, by phone,
              or without the buyer visiting the dealership premises before agreeing to purchase. Distance sales of vehicles
              are governed by the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013
              (CCR 2013). Dealers are legally required to provide mandatory pre-contract information and a written notice
              of the buyer's 14-day cooling-off period (right to cancel). Failure to do so is a criminal offence, and
              automatically extends the buyer's cancellation rights to 12 months. This tool generates a compliant
              distance sale information pack covering all mandatory CCR 2013 disclosures: trader identity, vehicle description,
              total price, delivery arrangements, cancellation rights, and refund policy.

            <h3>AI Dispute Response Builder</h3>
            <p>
              An AI-powered dispute response tool for UK used car dealers. When a customer submits a complaint about a
              used vehicle — alleging a fault, requesting a refund, or threatening legal action — the dealer must respond
              professionally and accurately citing relevant consumer law. This tool takes the details of the dispute:
              vehicle make, model, registration, purchase date, mileage at sale, current mileage, nature of the alleged
              fault, and any evidence available (including the PDI report). It then generates a structured, legally-referenced
              dispute response letter citing the Consumer Rights Act 2015, the applicable burden of proof timeline,
              the satisfactory quality standard, and proportionate remedies. Designed for independent used car dealers
              responding to consumer complaints without access to in-house legal teams.

          <p>
            The AutoProv Compliance Tools are built around the key pieces of UK legislation that govern the sale of
            used vehicles to consumers by motor traders.
          </p>

          <article>
            <h3>Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA 2015)</h3>
            <p>
              The Consumer Rights Act 2015 is the primary legislation governing the sale of goods — including used vehicles —
              from a trader to a consumer in the United Kingdom. Under the CRA 2015, vehicles must be of satisfactory quality,
              fit for purpose, and as described. Key provisions for car dealers include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>30-day short-term right to reject:</strong> Within 30 days of purchase, a consumer can reject the vehicle and receive a full refund if it is not of satisfactory quality.</li>
              <li><strong>6-month burden of proof:</strong> If a fault appears within the first 6 months, it is presumed to have existed at the point of sale. The dealer must prove otherwise.</li>
              <li><strong>One opportunity to repair or replace:</strong> Between 30 days and 6 months, the dealer must be given one chance to repair or replace before the consumer can claim a refund.</li>
              <li><strong>Satisfactory quality standard:</strong> Accounts for age, mileage, and price paid — an older, higher-mileage car is held to a lower standard than a nearly-new vehicle.</li>

            <h3>Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (CCR 2013)</h3>
            <p>
              The Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 govern distance selling and off-premises contracts in the UK,
              including the sale of vehicles online, by phone, or by any method where the buyer does not visit the
              dealer's premises before agreeing to purchase. Key requirements for car dealers under CCR 2013:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mandatory pre-contract information:</strong> Traders must provide specific information about the goods, price, delivery, and cancellation rights before the contract is agreed.</li>
              <li><strong>14-day cooling-off period:</strong> Consumers have 14 calendar days from delivery to cancel the contract without giving a reason.</li>
              <li><strong>Criminal offence:</strong> Failure to provide the required cancellation notice is a criminal offence under the CCR 2013.</li>
              <li><strong>Extended cancellation rights:</strong> If the cancellation notice is not provided, the consumer's cancellation rights extend to 12 months from the end of the original 14-day period.</li>

            <h3>Road Traffic Act</h3>
            <p>
              The Road Traffic Act imposes roadworthiness obligations on vehicle sellers. A used vehicle supplied
              by a dealer must be roadworthy at the point of sale. Selling an unroadworthy vehicle is an offence
              and also undermines the satisfactory quality standard under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.
              The PDI report helps evidence that a roadworthiness check was carried out before handover.

            <h3>Sale of Goods Act 1979</h3>
            <p>
              The Sale of Goods Act 1979 (SGA 1979) established the foundational implied terms in sale of goods contracts,
              including that goods must be of merchantable (now satisfactory) quality and fit for purpose. While largely
              superseded for consumer sales by the Consumer Rights Act 2015, the SGA 1979 may still be relevant for
              business-to-business vehicle sales in the motor trade.

          <h2 id="faq-heading">Frequently Asked Questions — AutoProv Compliance Tools</h2>

          <div>
            <h3>What are the AutoProv Compliance Tools?</h3>
            <p>
              The AutoProv Compliance Tools are a standalone compliance module released ahead of the full AutoProv platform.
              They include three digital tools for UK used car dealers: the Used Vehicle PDI Report, the Digital Distance Sale Pack,
              and the AI Dispute Response Builder. All three tools help used car dealers comply with UK consumer law,
              specifically the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>What is AutoProv?</h3>
            <p>
              AutoProv is a comprehensive automotive platform for the UK motor trade that covers far more than compliance.
              The compliance tools available at autexa.ai are an early-access module of the broader AutoProv ecosystem,
              which will expand to support many more aspects of running and growing a motor trade business.
              These compliance tools should not be confused with the full AutoProv platform.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>What is a PDI report and why do car dealers need one?</h3>
            <p>
              A PDI (Pre-Delivery Inspection) report is a formal checklist documenting a used vehicle's mechanical and
              cosmetic condition before it is handed to the buyer. It records checks on the engine, gearbox, brakes,
              tyres (including measured tread depths), bodywork, electrics, and interior. The customer signs the report
              at handover, confirming the vehicle's condition was disclosed. A completed PDI report is important evidence
              under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 — if a buyer later claims a fault existed at the point of sale,
              the PDI report documents the vehicle's condition and can support the dealer's position.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Do UK car dealers need a Distance Sale Pack?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. If a UK car dealer sells a vehicle without the buyer visiting the dealer's premises before agreeing
              to purchase — for example through an online listing, phone call, or digital channel — the sale is classified
              as a distance sale under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges)
              Regulations 2013 (CCR 2013). The dealer must provide a written Distance Sale Pack containing mandatory
              pre-contract information and a formal notice of the buyer's 14-day cooling-off right to cancel.
              Not providing this documentation is a criminal offence and automatically extends the buyer's cancellation
              rights from 14 days to 12 months.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>How does the AI Dispute Response Builder work?</h3>
            <p>
              The AI Dispute Response Builder takes the key facts of a customer complaint — vehicle details, purchase date,
              mileage, nature of the alleged fault, and available evidence such as the PDI report — and generates a
              professional, structured dispute response letter. The letter is referenced to the Consumer Rights Act 2015,
              considers the relevant burden of proof timeline and satisfactory quality standard, and proposes a proportionate
              response. It is designed for UK used car dealers who need to respond to consumer complaints without access
              to an in-house legal team.
            </p>

            <h3>What consumer law applies to used car sales in the UK?</h3>
            <p>
              The key pieces of consumer law affecting used car sales in the UK are: the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA 2015),
              which governs the quality, fitness for purpose, and description of goods sold by traders to consumers;
              the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (CCR 2013),
              which apply to distance sales of vehicles; the Road Traffic Act, which governs roadworthiness;
              and the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which applies to business-to-business vehicle sales.
            </p>

            <h3>Are the AutoProv Compliance Tools free?</h3>
            <p>
              The AutoProv Compliance Tools — including the Used Vehicle PDI Report, Digital Distance Sale Pack,
              and AI Dispute Response Builder — are currently available as an early-access release ahead of the full
              AutoProv platform. Visit autexa.ai to access the tools.
