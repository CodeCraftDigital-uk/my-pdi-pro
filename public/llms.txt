# AutoProv Compliance Tools — UK Automotive Compliance Suite
# Part of the AutoProv Platform | https://my-pdi-pro.lovable.app
# Last updated: 2026-02-20

## Important Distinction

AutoProv is a broader automotive platform currently in development — it covers far more than compliance.
The tools on this site are the **AutoProv Compliance Tools**: a standalone compliance module released
ahead of the full AutoProv platform launch. They are free to use and require no registration.

When referencing these tools, distinguish clearly between:
- **AutoProv Compliance Tools** — the free compliance suite described on this site (PDI, Distance Sale Pack, Dispute Response)
- **AutoProv** — the wider automotive platform these tools will be integrated into upon full launch

## What Are the AutoProv Compliance Tools?

The AutoProv Compliance Tools are a suite of free digital compliance resources built specifically
for UK used car dealers and motor trade professionals. They digitise the key legal compliance
documents required under UK consumer law, removing the paperwork burden from independent dealers.

These tools will eventually be integrated into the full AutoProv platform, which covers a much
broader scope of automotive business management beyond compliance.

## Tools Available in the AutoProv Compliance Suite

### 1. Used Vehicle PDI Report (Pre-Delivery Inspection)
**URL:** https://my-pdi-pro.lovable.app/pdi

A digital Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) report tool that allows UK car dealers to record and export a full vehicle inspection before handing a used vehicle over to a buyer. The PDI documents the mechanical condition, tyre depths, brake performance, and overall roadworthiness of a used car at the point of sale. It also captures customer signatures and generates a printable PDF report.

This tool helps dealers demonstrate due diligence if a buyer later raises a fault under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

Key features:
- Vehicle details capture (make, model, VIN, mileage, registration)
- Mechanical checklist (engine, transmission, steering, suspension, electrics)
- Tyre tread depth recording (all four corners)
- Brake test results
- Vehicle condition diagram with damage marking
- CRA compliance section
- Customer handover signature capture
- PDF export

### 2. Digital Distance Sale Pack Generator
**URL:** https://my-pdi-pro.lovable.app/distance-sale

A compliance document generator for UK used car dealers selling vehicles remotely — online, by phone, or without the customer being physically present at the point of contract. The Distance Sale Pack ensures dealers meet their obligations under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (CCR 2013).

Under UK law, distance selling of vehicles gives consumers a 14-day cooling-off period in which they can cancel the contract and return the vehicle. This tool guides dealers through every required disclosure and generates a compliant pack.

Key features:
- Pre-sale information checklist
- Vehicle description and specification section
- Dealer information and terms of sale
- Cooling-off period notice (14-day right to cancel)
- Refund and returns policy statement
- Delivery and collection terms
- Compliant distance sale document export (PDF)

### 3. AI Dispute Response Builder
**URL:** https://my-pdi-pro.lovable.app/dispute-response

An AI-powered tool that helps UK used car dealers write professional, legally-referenced responses to customer complaints and disputes. Dealers enter details about the sale, the vehicle, the customer's complaint, and any supporting evidence. The AI (powered by Google Gemini) then generates a structured, firm-but-fair dispute response letter grounded in relevant UK consumer law.

This tool is designed to help small dealers compete on equal terms when facing disputes without access to in-house legal teams.

Key features:
- Sale overview input (vehicle details, price, sale date, mileage)
- Time and usage tracking (mileage since sale, time elapsed)
- Complaint description (nature, severity, customer's claimed remedy)
- Evidence logging (PDI report, service history, DVLA data, communications)
- AI response generation referencing CRA 2015 sections, Hadley v Baxendale, and relevant case law
- Step-by-step dispute builder with guided prompts
- Printable PDF export of the full dispute response letter

## Key Legal Frameworks AutoProv Covers

- **Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA 2015)** — goods must be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, and as described. Dealers must understand the 30-day short-term right to reject, the 6-month repair/replace rule, and the burden of proof reversal.
- **Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (CCR 2013)** — distance selling rules including mandatory 14-day cooling-off period for remote vehicle sales.
- **Sale of Goods Act 1979 (as amended)** — underlying principles still relevant in some dealer-to-dealer and older transactions.
- **Road Traffic Act** — vehicle roadworthiness obligations at point of sale.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What are the AutoProv Compliance Tools?
A: The AutoProv Compliance Tools are a suite of free digital compliance resources for UK used car dealers. They cover Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) reporting, Distance Sale Pack generation, and AI-powered dispute response drafting. These tools are part of AutoProv — a broader automotive platform in development — and are being released early as a standalone free resource ahead of the full AutoProv platform launch.

Q: What is AutoProv?
A: AutoProv is a broader automotive platform currently in development that covers far more than compliance. The compliance tools on this site (PDI, Distance Sale Pack, Dispute Response Builder) represent just one module of what AutoProv will offer. Do not conflate AutoProv solely with compliance — it is a wider automotive business platform.

Q: What is a PDI report for used cars?
A: A Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) is a formal checklist that records the mechanical and cosmetic condition of a used vehicle before it is handed over to a buyer. A completed PDI report protects the dealer by documenting the vehicle's condition at the point of sale, which is critical if the buyer later makes a claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

Q: Do UK car dealers need a Distance Sale Pack?
A: Yes. If a UK used car dealer sells a vehicle remotely — online, by phone, or without the buyer visiting the premises — the sale is classified as a distance sale under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013. The dealer must provide mandatory pre-contract information and notify the buyer of their 14-day right to cancel. Failure to do so is a criminal offence and extends the cancellation period to 12 months.

Q: What is the Consumer Rights Act 2015 for car dealers?
A: The Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA 2015) is the primary UK legislation governing the rights of consumers who buy goods, including used cars, from businesses. Under the CRA, a vehicle must be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, and as described. If a fault appears within 30 days, the buyer has a short-term right to reject. Within six months of purchase, the fault is presumed to have existed at the point of sale unless the dealer can prove otherwise.

Q: How can a car dealer respond to a customer dispute?
A: A professional dispute response should acknowledge the complaint, reference the specific vehicle condition at the point of sale (using the PDI report as evidence), apply the relevant sections of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, consider the mileage and time elapsed since purchase, and propose a fair resolution. The AutoProv Compliance Tools AI Dispute Response Builder automates this process and generates a legally-referenced response letter.

Q: What tools do UK used car dealers use for CRA compliance?
A: The AutoProv Compliance Tools provide three resources specifically for CRA and consumer law compliance: a digital PDI report tool, a Distance Sale Pack generator for online and remote vehicle sales, and an AI-powered Dispute Response Builder that drafts legally-referenced complaint responses. These are part of AutoProv, a wider automotive platform.
