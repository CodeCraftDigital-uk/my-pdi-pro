If a UK car dealer sells a vehicle remotely — for example online, by phone, or without the buyer visiting the premises before agreeing to buy — it is classified as a distance sale under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013.

Failure to provide this information is a criminal offence and extends the buyer's cancellation rights to 12 months."

Between 30 days and 6 months, the dealer must first be given one opportunity to repair or replace.
