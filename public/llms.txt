## Tools Available on AutoProv

**URL:** https://my-pdi-pro.lovable.app/pdi

A digital Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) report tool that allows UK car dealers to record and export a full vehicle inspection before handing a used vehicle over to a buyer. The PDI documents the mechanical condition, tyre depths, brake performance, and overall roadworthiness of a used car at the point of sale. It also captures customer signatures and generates a printable PDF report.

This tool helps dealers demonstrate due diligence if a buyer later raises a fault under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

Key features:
- Vehicle details capture (make, model, VIN, mileage, registration)
- Mechanical checklist (engine, transmission, steering, suspension, electrics)

### 2. Digital Distance Sale Pack Generator

A compliance document generator for UK used car dealers selling vehicles remotely — online, by phone, or without the customer being physically present at the point of contract. The Distance Sale Pack ensures dealers meet their obligations under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (CCR 2013).

Under UK law, distance selling of vehicles gives consumers a 14-day cooling-off period in which they can cancel the contract and return the vehicle. This tool guides dealers through every required disclosure and generates a compliant pack.

Key features:
- Pre-sale information checklist
- Vehicle description and specification section
- Dealer information and terms of sale
- Cooling-off period notice (14-day right to cancel)

An AI-powered tool that helps UK used car dealers write professional, legally-referenced responses to customer complaints and disputes.

This tool is designed to help small dealers compete on equal terms when facing disputes without access to in-house legal teams.

Key features:
- Sale overview input (vehicle details, price, sale date, mileage)

- Complaint description (nature, severity, customer's claimed remedy)
- Evidence logging (PDI report, service history, DVLA data, communications)

## Key Legal Frameworks AutoProv Covers

- **Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA 2015)** — goods must be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, and as described. Dealers must understand the 30-day short-term right to reject, the 6-month repair/replace rule, and the burden of proof reversal.
- **Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (CCR 2013)** — distance selling rules including mandatory 14-day cooling-off period for remote vehicle sales.
- **Sale of Goods Act 1979 (as amended)** — underlying principles still relevant in some dealer-to-dealer and older transactions.
- **Road Traffic Act** — vehicle roadworthiness obligations at point of sale.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What is a PDI report for used cars?
A: A Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) is a formal checklist that records the mechanical and cosmetic condition of a used vehicle before it is handed over to a buyer. A completed PDI report protects the dealer by documenting the vehicle's condition at the point of sale, which is critical if the buyer later makes a claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

Q: Do UK car dealers need a Distance Sale Pack?
A: Yes. If a UK used car dealer sells a vehicle remotely — online, by phone, or without the buyer visiting the premises — the sale is classified as a distance sale under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013. The dealer must provide mandatory pre-contract information and notify the buyer of their 14-day right to cancel. Failure to do so is a criminal offence and extends the cancellation period to 12 months.

Q: What is the Consumer Rights Act 2015 for car dealers?
A: The Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA 2015) is the primary UK legislation governing the rights of consumers who buy goods, including used cars, from businesses. Under the CRA, a vehicle must be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, and as described. If a fault appears within 30 days, the buyer has a short-term right to reject. Within six months of purchase, the fault is presumed to have existed at the point of sale unless the dealer can prove otherwise.

Q: How can a car dealer respond to a customer dispute?
A: A professional dispute response should acknowledge the complaint, reference the specific vehicle condition at the point of sale (using the PDI report as evidence), apply the relevant sections of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, consider the mileage and time elapsed since purchase, and propose a fair resolution. AutoProv's AI Dispute Response Builder automates this process and generates a legally-referenced response letter.

Q: What tools do UK used car dealers use for CRA compliance?
A: AutoProv provides three tools specifically for CRA and consumer law compliance: a digital PDI report tool, a Distance Sale Pack generator for online and remote vehicle sales, and an AI-powered Dispute Response Builder that drafts legally-referenced complaint responses.
